Commencing with, on 31 st of July 2025, I SOHAM SOOD a student from a small district of HARYANA, embarked on a new jouney of thrilling experiences which would make me some steps in the direction of achieving my desired goals.So,the day started with worshiping the almighty who has blessed us to do the hardwork so we have made our way to GNDEC,Ludhaina.We students of GNDEC assembled in the gurudwara sabhib at 8:30 in the morming and we prayed in front of almighty to hold our hands tight in the whole jounrney so we donot get diverted from our goals and also not forget our roots. Although, i was so nervous in the morining about my first day because every face was new for me and me belonging to another state was fearing nut as soon as i entered gurudwara the jap ji sahib path by the granthi ji made me so calm that i was fully mixed in the students. The kirtani jaths from ludhiana sung so melodious kirtan that i was mesmorised.This program eneded with ardaas for the wellbeing of students and praying god for enlighteninng our paths.
